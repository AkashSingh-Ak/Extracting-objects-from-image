# Extracting Car/Objects form Image

Extracting objects from image is kind a difficult because you have make minor adjustments on the code each time when working with new image.
But there is a model name **U^2-Net** trained and ready to generates outout as masks of the object from input image. This makes it a lot easie to extract masks with minimum efforts.
But the model is 80% accurate, if the image background ia complex. We have to perform some minor adjustments on the the image to make it perect.

**Here is the link of U^2-Net mode repository in GitHub**

**This is what I've done in this project.**


**I took the output generated by U^2-Net model and make some minor adjustments on it to get th final result**

## Installation

You need to install following libraries in order to execute the code

if you are using python
```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install scikit-image
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
```
if you are using Anaconda
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
conda install -c anaconda scikit-image
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
conda install -c anaconda numpy
```

**Input Image to the U^2-Net model**

 <img width = "500" src="./test_car.jpg">
 
 **Output image from the U^2-Net mode**
 
 <img width = "500" src="./test_car.png">
 
 **After performing adjustments**
 
 <img width = "500" src="./Final_mask.PNG">

**Final Output**

<img width = "500" src="./output.png">
